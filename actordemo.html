			<p>I love stories, I always have. From as far back as I can remember my vast and wild imagination created worlds that I would play out in my backyard with weapons and armor made from our recycle bin. Story telling is part of me...acting is my way of telling those stories. I want to give a voice to those who have none, or are too scared to tell their stories themselves. I believe that when the darkness in this world is brought into the light, it becomes easier to change. </p>
